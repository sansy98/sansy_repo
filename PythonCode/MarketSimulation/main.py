#Determine the price profitability with PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND: e = (p/q)*(dq/dp) ||Â e = p/q(p) * q'(p) 
#|e| > 1, the price is ELASTIC      (%âQ > %âP)     => DECREASE PRICE
#|e| < 1, the price is INELASTIC    (%âQ < %âP)     => INCREASE PRICE
#|e| = 1, the price is UNIT ELASTIC (%âQ = %âP)     => MANTAIN PRICE  (price is optimal)
